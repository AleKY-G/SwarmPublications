======DESCRIPTION============================================================
 Video attachment for “Algorithms for Shaping a Particle Swarm with a Shared Input by Exploiting Non-Slip Wall Contacts“ by Shiva Shahrokhi, Arun Mahadev and Aaron T. Becker, at the University of Houston. 

We present algorithms for shaping particle swarms in 2D using non-slip contact with walls and a shared control input. The delta configuration space with different initial and final positions of two particles is shown first. Then implementations of positioning two particles are shown in simulation. Next are simulation and hardware experiments that extend this algorithm to n particle positioning.
