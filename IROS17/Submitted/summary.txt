Video attachment for “Algorithms For Shaping a Particle Swarm With a Shared Control Input Using Boundary Interaction“ by Shiva Shahrokhi, Arun Mahadev and Aaron T. Becker, at the University of Houston. We present algorithms for shaping particle swarms in 2D using boundary interaction and a shared control input. First the videos shows the delta configuration space for different initial and final positions for robots. Then implementations of positioning two robots are shown in simulation. Next are simulation and hardware experiments that extend this algorithm to n robot positioning.
