This is on controlling a swarm of passive particles by an
external field making clever use of (idealized) boundary
contacts.

The approach is a clever and an original idea. However, the
approach relies on certain assumptions that are not
extensively discussed, not all details are explained well,
and there are unexplained differences between the
theoretical approach and the executed robot experiments.
