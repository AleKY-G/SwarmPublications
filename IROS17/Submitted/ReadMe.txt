======DESCRIPTION============================================================
 Video attachment for “Algorithms For Shaping a Particle Swarm With a Shared Control Input Using Boundary Interaction“ by Shiva Shahrokhi, Arun Mahadev and Aaron T. Becker, at the University of Houston. 

We present algorithms for shaping particle swarms in 2D using boundary integration and a shared control input. The delta configuration space with different initial and final positions of two robots is shown first. Then implementations of positioning two robots are shown in simulation. Next are simulation and hardware experiments that extend this algorithm to n robot positioning.
