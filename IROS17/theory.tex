\emph{Using Boundaries: Friction and Boundary Layers}\label{subsec:WallFriction}

Global inputs move a swarm uniformly.  
Shape control requires breaking this uniform symmetry.

The following sections examine using boundaries that stop the particles if they are pushed into the wall.
 These forces are  sufficient to break the symmetry caused by uniform inputs.
