	Abstract = {Micro- and nanorobots can be built in large numbers, but generating independent control inputs for each robot is prohibitively difficult.  Instead, micro- and nanorobots are often controlled by a global field.  In previous work we conducted large-scale human-user experiments where humans played games that steered large swarms of simple robots to complete tasks such as manipulating blocks. One surprising result was that humans completed a block-pushing task \emph{faster} when provided with only the mean and variance of the robot swarm than with full-state feedback.  Inspired by human operators, this paper investigates controllers that use only the mean and variance of a robot swarm. We prove that the mean position is controllable, and show how an obstacle can make the variance controllable.  We next derive automatic controllers for these and a hybrid, hysteresis-based switching control to regulate the first two moments of the robot distribution.  Finally, we employ these controllers as primitives for a block-pushing task.

	Abstract = {Microrobots have been proposed for future biomedical applications in which they are able to navigate in viscous fluidic environments. Nature has inspired numerous microrobotic locomotion designs{,} which are suitable for propulsion generation at low Reynolds numbers. This article reviews the various swimming methods with particular focus on helical propulsion inspired by E. coli bacteria. There are various magnetic actuation methods for biomimetic and non-biomimetic microrobots{,} such as rotating fields{,} oscillating fields{,} or field gradients. They can be categorized into force-driven or torque-driven actuation methods. Both approaches are reviewed and a previous publication has shown that torque-driven actuation scales better to the micro- and nano-scale than force-driven actuation. Finally{,} the implementation of swarm or multi-agent control is discussed. The use of multiple microrobots may be beneficial for in vivo as well as in vitro applications. Thus{,} the frequency-dependent behavior of helical microrobots is discussed and preliminary experimental results are presented showing the decoupling of an individual agent within a group of three microrobots.},

Here we show that the observed movement of the nanocars is a new type of fullerene-based wheel-like rolling motion, not stick?slip or sliding translation, due to evidence including directional preference in both direct and indirect manipulation and studies of related molecular structures.},

	Abstract = {Roboticists, biologists, and chemists are now producing large populations of simple robots, but controlling large populations of robots with limited capabilities is  difficult, due to communication and onboard-computation constraints. Direct human control of large populations seems even more challenging.
 
In this paper we investigate control of mobile robots that move in a 2D workspace using three different system models. We focus on a model that uses broadcast control inputs specified in the global reference frame.
 
In an obstacle-free workspace this system model is uncontrollable because it has only two controllable degrees of freedom---all robots receive the same inputs and move uniformly. We prove that adding a single obstacle can make the system controllable, for any number of robots. We provide a position control algorithm, and demonstrate through extensive testing with human subjects that many manipulation tasks can be reliably completed, even by novice users, under this system model, with performance benefits compared to the alternate models. 

We compare the sensing, computation, communication, time, and bandwidth costs for all three system models. Results are validated with extensive simulations and hardware experiments using over 100 robots.},

	Abstract = {In this work, we develop methods for controlling multiple untethered magnetic micro-robots (Mag-mBots) without the need for a specialized substrate. We investigate Mag-mBots that are geometrically and magnetically designed to respond uniquely to the same input magnetic fields. Designs include: (1) geometrically similar Mag-mBots with different values of magnetization; (2) geometrically dissimilar Mag-mBots with similar magnetization; and (3) geometrically dissimilar Mag-mBots with dissimilar magnetization. The responses of both magnetically hard and soft Mag-mBots are investigated. By controlling the input magnetic fields, individual and sub-groups of Mag-mBots are able to locomote in a parallel fashion. Specifically, the magnitude and frequency of the imposed driving magnetic fields are used as selection methods among the Mag-mBots. Various methods for accomplishing motion discrimination are discussed, modeled, and tested. It is found that while fully decoupled control is not possible with this method, parallel actuation of sub-groups of Mag-mBots is possible and controllable.},

	Abstract = {A major challenge for untethered microscale mobile robotics is the control of many agents in the same workspace for distributed operation. In this work, we present a new method to independently control multiple sub-mm microrobots in three dimensions (3D) using magnetic gradient pulling as the 3D motion generation method. Motion differentiation is accomplished through the use of geometrically or magnetically distinct microrobots which assume different magnetization directions in a rotating or oscillating magnetic field. This allows for different magnetic forces to be exerted on each, enabling independent motion control and path following of multiple microrobots along arbitrary 3D trajectories. Path following in 3D with less than 310 μm mean error is shown for a set of two microrobots of size 350 μm and 1500 μm, and independent motions are shown with three microrobots. It is also shown that control of more microrobots could be possible using improved magnetic coil hardware. Microrobot diversity is analyzed with regards to the effect on independent control. The proposed addressability method could be used for the 3D control of a team of microrobots inside microfluidic channels or in the human body for localized therapy or diagnostics.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we derive a globally asymptotically
stabilizing feedback control policy for a collection of
differential-drive robots under the constraint that every robot
receives exactly the same control inputs. We begin by assuming
that each robot has a slightly different wheel size, which scales
its forward speed and turning rate by a constant that can be
found by offline or online calibration. The resulting feedback
policy is easy to implement, is robust to standard models of
noise, and scales to an arbitrary number (even a continuous
ensemble) of robots. We validate this policy with hardware
experiments, which additionally reveal that our feedback policy
still works when the wheel sizes are unknown and even when the
wheel sizes are all approximately identical. These results have
possible future application to control of micro- and nano-scale
robotic systems, which are often subject to similar constraints.},

Our goal is to control a cluster of microorganisms as microscale smart robots for various applications, since microorganisms have efficient actuators and accurate sensors. Compared with single-cell level actuation methods proposed before, this method has the following advantages: (1) a cluster of microorganisms can cancel stochastic perturbations of behavior by taking the average; (2) a cluster of microorganisms can be more powerful than a single microorganism, and thus it can perform a variety of tasks. A visual feedback system is constructed to control cells using galvanotaxis (response to the electric field). Experimental results show the feasibility of visual feedback control of a paramecium cell cluster. In addition, micro-manipulation of small objects by the cell cluster is also demonstrated

We define an equation that relates fan-out to a robot's activity time and its interaction time. We describe how to measure activity time and fan-out. We then use the fan-out equation to compute interaction effort. We can use this interaction effort as a measure of the effectiveness of a human-robot interaction design.

robots to manipulate a polygonal object in the plane in the
presence of obstacles. The proposed approach is based on the computation
of maximal discs (dubbed maximum independent capture
discs, or MICaDs) where the robots can move independently while
preventing the object from escaping their grasp. It is shown that, in
the absence of obstacles, it is always possible to bring a polygonal
object from any configuration to any other one with robot motions
constrained to lie in a set of overlapping MICaDs. This approach
is generalized to the case where obstacles are present by decomposing
the corresponding motion planning task into the construction
of a collision-free path for a modified form of the object, and
the execution of this path by a sequence of simultaneous and independent
robot motions within overlapping MICaDs. The proposed
algorithm is guaranteed to generate a valid plan, provided a collision-
free path exists for the modified form of the object. It has been
implemented and experiments with Nomadic Scout mobile robots
are presented.},

Abstract: We present a decentralized approach to multi- robot manipulation where the team of robots surround and trap an object and transport it, by dragging or pushing, to the goal configuration in an environment with obstacles. The proposed feedback controllers are obtained by sequentially composing vector fields or behaviors and are decentralized in the sense that robots do not exchange each other's state information. Rather, cooperative manipulation is achieved by relying solely on each robot's local information and a global knowledge of the task. We present computer simulations and experimental results obtained using our multi-robot testbed.

Abstract: When a polygonal object is pushed with line contact along an edge, the push is called stable if the object remains fixed to the pusher. The object is small-time locally controllable by stable pushing if, by switching among pushing edges, it can be pushed to follow any path arbitrarily closely. Since the pushes are stable by the frictional mechanics, pushing plans can be executed without position feedback of the object. We derive a necessary and sufficient condition for a polygon to be small-time locally controllable by stable pushing: the pushing friction coefficient must be nonzero and the set of feasible pure forces (forces applied through a polygon edge and passing through the center of friction) must positively span the plane. We interpret this condition in terms of the polygon shape, the location of the center of friction, and the pushing friction coefficient, allowing us to characterize classes of polygons with this fundamental ``manoeuvrability'' property

	Abstract = {In this paper, we show how to combine microfluidics and feedback control to independently steer multiple particles with micrometer accuracy in two spatial dimensions. The particles are steered by creating a fluid flow that carries all the particles from where they are to where they should be at each time step. Our control loop comprises sensing, computation, and actuation to steer particles along user-input trajectories. Particle locations are identified in real-time by an optical system and transferred to a control algorithm that then determines the electrode voltages necessary to create a flow field to carry all the particles to their next desired locations. The process repeats at the next time instant. Our method achieves inexpensive steering of particles by using conventional electroosmotic actuation in microfluidic channels. This type of particle steering does not require optical traps and can noninvasively steer neutral or charged particles and objects that cannot be captured by laser tweezers. (Laser tweezers cannot steer reflective particles, or particles where the index of refraction is lower than (or for more sophisticated optical vortex holographic tweezers does not differ substantially from) that of the surrounding medium.) We show proof-of-concept PDMS devices, having four and eight electrodes, with control algorithms that can steer one and three particles, respectively. In particular, we demonstrate experimentally that it is possible to use electroosmotic flow to accurately steer and trap multiple particles at once},

Abstract: In current robotics research there is a vast body of work on algorithms and control methods for groups of decentralized cooperating robots, called a swarm or collective. These algorithms are generally meant to control collectives of hundreds or even thousands of robots; however, for reasons of cost, time, or complexity, they are generally validated in simulation only, or on a group of a few tens of robots. To address this issue, this paper presents Kilobot, a low-cost robot designed to make testing collective algorithms on hundreds or thousands of robots accessible to robotics researchers. To enable the possibility of large Kilobot collectives where the number of robots is an order of magnitude larger than the largest that exist today, each robot is made with only $14 worth of parts and takes 5 minutes to assemble. Furthermore, the robot design allows a single user to easily operate a large Kilobot collective, such as programming, powering on, and charging all robots, which would be difficult or impossible to do with many existing robotic systems.
