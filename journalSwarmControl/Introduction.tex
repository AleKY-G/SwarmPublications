\section{Introduction}\label{sec:Intro}
%This project studies system models and user interfaces for five multi-robot manipulation tasks with large populations of micro- and nanorobots.  We test several system models with different limitations on controllability and observability of the motion controller, and evaluate several different user interfaces.  We conduct user experiments to understand the impact of these limitations and design choices. 


%Micro- and nanorobotics have the potential to revolutionize many applications including targeted material delivery, assembly, and surgery.  The same properties that promise breakthrough solutions---small size and large populations---present unique challenges to generating controlled motion.  
Large populations of micro- and nanorobots are being produced in laboratories around the world, with diverse potential applications in drug delivery and construction, see \cite{Peyer2013,Shirai2005,Chiang2011}. These activities require robots that behave intelligently.
Limited computation and communication rules out autonomous operation or direct control over individual units; instead we must rely on global control signals broadcast to the entire particle population.    
This paper examines object manipulation by a swarm of particles, each actuated by the same shared global input, as illustrated in Fig.~{\ref{fig:bigPictureMeanAndVarianceForSwarm}.


%%%% Move it to the cover letter.
%This paper combines the content of two preliminary conference papers, extending their substance and providing full details in a single journal paper.
 % \cite{swarmcontrol2013} covered the first three months of SwarmControl.net experiments, and \cite{ShahrokhiIROS2015} presented simulations of object manipulation.  This paper presents three years of results from new games at SwarmControl.net.  For object manipulation, this paper presents robust new algorithms for manipulation, path planning, and obstacle avoidance, and a rich set of parametric studies.  All hardware validation experiments are new.

Many promising applications for particle swarms require direct human control, but user interfaces to thousands---or millions---of particles is a daunting human-swarm interaction (HSI) challenge. Our early work with over a hundred hardware robots and thousands of simulated particles demonstrated that direct human control of large swarms is possible, \cite{Becker2013b}. 
Unfortunately, the logistical challenges of repeated experiments with over one hundred robots prevented large-scale tests. 
There is currently no comprehensive understanding of user interfaces for controlling multi-robot systems with massive populations.  
One contribution of this paper is a tool for investigating HSI methods through statistically significant numbers of experiments.

A swarm of particles, all controlled by a uniform control input, can be effectively controlled by a hybrid controller that knows only the mean and variance of the robot distribution.  
Here a swarm of particles (kilobot robots) pushes a green hexagon toward the goal (see video attachment).

%It is not always practical to gather pose information on individual robots for feedback control; the robots might be difficult or impossible to sense individually due to their size and location. However, it is often possible to sense global properties of the group, such as mean position and density.
Often particles are difficult or impossible to sense individually due to their size and location. 
For example, microrobots are smaller than the minimum resolution of a clinical MRI-scanner, see \cite{martel2014computer}, however it is often possible to sense global properties of the group such as mean position and variance. 
To make progress in automatic control with global inputs, this paper presents swarm manipulation controllers inspired by our online experiments that require only mean and variance measurements of the particle's positions.  
These controllers are used as primitives to perform the object manipulation task illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:bigPictureMeanAndVarianceForSwarm}.


 %function and implementation function

 Our paper is organized as follows.  After a discussion of related work in \S \ref{sec:RelatedWork},  we describe our experimental methods for an online human-user experiment and their results in \S \ref{sec:expMethods}. Inspired by these results, we prove that the mean and variance of a particle swarm are controllable in \S \ref{sec:theory}, and present automatic controllers in \S \ref{sec:simulation}. We use these controllers as primitives and present a framework for manipulating an object through a maze in \S \ref{sec:exp}. 
 We conclude with implementations of these controllers in our hardware robots and use them to complete an object manipulation task with 100 kilobots in \S \ref{sec:realExperiment}.
