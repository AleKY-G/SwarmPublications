%\subsection{Controlling Torque}


The orientation of an object's major axis is important when a swarm is manipulating a non-symmetric object through narrow corridors. 
Orientation is controllable by applying torque to the object. 
To change the output torque $\tau$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq:torque}, we can choose the direction and magnitude of the force applied $F$, and the moment arm from the object's center of mass (COM) to the point of contact $r$.

\begin{equation}
\tau = F \times r\label{eq:torque}
\end{equation}
The swarm version of \eqref{eq:torque} is the summation of the forces contributed by individual robots.

\begin{align}
\tau_{total} &= \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \rho_i F_i \times (P_i - O )   \label{eq:swarmtorque}\\
F_{total} &= \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \rho_i F_i  \label{eq:swarmforce}
\end{align}

Here $F_i$ is the force that the $i$th robot applies.  If all robots are identical and the control input is uniform, the force is equivalent for every robot and $F_i = F_c$.
Not all robots are in contact with the object.  $\rho_i$ is an indicator variable: $\rho_i$ is 1 if the robot is in direct contact with the object or touching a chain of robots where at least one robot is in contact with the object. Otherwise $\rho_i = 0$.
The moment arm is the robot's position $P_i$ to the object's COM $O=[O_x,O_y]^{\top}$.

\begin{equation}
P(x) = \frac{1}{{\sigma \sqrt {2\pi } }}e^{{{ - \left( {x - \mu } \right)^2 } \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{ - \left( {x - \mu } \right)^2 } {2\sigma ^2 }}} \right. \kern-\nulldelimiterspace} {2\sigma ^2 }}}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\tau = \int_0^1\frac{1}{{\sigma \sqrt {2\pi } }}e^{{{ - \left( {x - \mu } \right)^2 } \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{ - \left( {x - \mu } \right)^2 } {2\sigma ^2 }}} \right. \kern-\nulldelimiterspace} {2\sigma ^2 }}} x \, dx
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{2} \mu  (\text{erf}(1.41421 (1-\mu ))+\text{erf}(1.41421 \mu ))+0.199471 \left(e^{-2. \mu
   ^2}-e^{-2. (\mu -1)^2}\right)
\end{equation}
