 Video attachment for “Algorithms For Shaping a Particle Swarm With a Shared Control Input Using Boundary Interaction“ by Shiva Shahrokhi, Arun Mahadev and Aaron T. Becker, at the University of Houston. 

Considering a swarm of particles controlled by global inputs, we present algorithms for shaping such swarms in 2D using boundary walls. Videos first shows our kilobots and light as global inputs. It shows some of the applications in the following frames. We show how conforming to the boundary will enable us to make different shapes in square and circle workspace. Then implementations of two robots positioning is shown in simulation and hardware experiments. We show implementation of the extension of this algorithm to n robot positioning in simulation and hardware. We conclude with showing covariance control in simulation and hardware experiments for the robots that have stochastic behavior.
