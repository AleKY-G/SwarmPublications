The authors answered all the questions and comments asked by reviewers
and revised the paper. However, the clarity of the revised paper is
still not very good. The main contribution of this paper is difficultly
to be caught. Detailed comments are as follows:
1.	In Pg.1, Sect. I, Line 14-15:  “Our control problem is to
design the control inputs u(t) to make all n particles achieve a task.”
 However, the control u(t) cannot be found in the following sections.
2.	From Eq.(1), the control u(t) is the velocity of the robots.
However, in Pg.2, Sect.III, Part A, “For notational simplicity, the
swarm is parameterized by the global control input signal \beta and the
fill-level h.”	This sentence is in front of Eq.(7).  Is \beta the
global control input signal? \beta is the movement direction of the
robot according to Fig.2. 
3.	What is the meaning of “the fill-level h ”?
4.	And in Pg.3, Sect.III, Part B, what is uf? Why it is assumed to
be infinite? In Eq.(9), as uf.N<Fsin(\sita), Ff=uf.N. If uf is
infinite, Ff should be only as Fsin(\sita).
5.	The Eq.(10) is confused. Is y the component of position vector
[x,y]? 
6.	How does DriftMove() work?  Are \beta and \alfa angles?

In general, this paper has publish points and the multimedia video
shows abundant simulation and experiement  results. However,there are a
number of ambiguous expressions in this paper. Authors should improve
the clarity of this paper.
