Video attachment for “Algorithms For Shaping a Particle Swarm With a Shared Control Input Using Boundary Interaction“ by Shiva Shahrokhi, Arun Mahadev and Aaron T. Becker, at the University of Houston. We present algorithms for shaping particle swarms in 2D using boundary walls and a shared control input. Video first shows kilobot robots programmed to move toward a bright light. Second are videos of two applications that require shape control of a particle swarm (from previous work using a human to steer the swarm). Third are animations of the set of configurations a particle swarm can achieve under global inputs in a square and circular workspace. Then implementations of positioning two robots are shown in simulation and hardware experiments. Next are simulation and hardware experiments that extend this algorithm to n robot positioning. We conclude by showing efficient correlation control in simulation and hardware experiments for robot swarms.
