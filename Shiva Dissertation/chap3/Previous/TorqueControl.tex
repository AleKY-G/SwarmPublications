%Manipulating objects with a swarm of simple robots with global control inputs is difficult because they are highly under-actuated, the number of robots in contact with object changes dynamically, the robots contacting each other changes dynamically, and because the robots disperse over time they must be recollected.
%
%This work presents controllers and algorithms for steering such an under-actuated swarm to manipulate objects. Previous work showed that mean and variance of the swarm is controllable. This was used to manipulate convex polygonal objects through a simple maze. A key remaining challenge is controlling the torque applied to an object. Torque control is necessary for manipulating objects as well as for aligning sensors, emitters, or redirecting an incoming signal. This work first proves that swarm torque control is possible, then presents algorithms to automate the task. The paper concludes with experimental results using 100 hardware robots to manipulate rectangles with large aspect ratios.
