%\begin{abstract}

%Steered particles offer a method for targeted therapy, interventions, and drug delivery in regions inaccessible by large robots.
%Magnetic actuation has the benefits of requiring no tethers, being able to operate from a distance, and in some cases allows imaging for feedback (e.g. MRI).
% This paper investigates particle control with uniform magnetic gradients (the same force is applied everywhere in the workspace).
%Given three orthogonal magnetic fields, steering one particle in 3D is trivial. 
%Adding additional particles to steer makes the system underactuated because there are more states than control inputs. 
%However, the walls of in vivo and artificial environments often have surface roughness such that the particles do not move unless actuation pulls them away from the wall.
%In previous work, we showed that the individual 2D position of two particles is controllable in a square workspace with non-slip wall contact \cite{shahrokhi2017algorithms}.
%Because in vivo environments are usually not square, this paper extends the previous work to all convex workspaces and to 3D positioning. 
%This paper also implements the algorithms using a hardware setup inspired by the gastrointestinal tract.
